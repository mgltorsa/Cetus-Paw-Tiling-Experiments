    "This paperwork will analyze data obtained from tiling experiments to compare 4 features of 4 different algorithms' implementations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The features or variables to measure are the following:\n",
    "- Algorithm speed up\n",
    "- Cache misses\n",

    "- Cores rate usage\n",

    "The 4 algorithms selected for the experiment were:\n",

    "- Jacobi Example\n",
